## About
VanillaHRM is an original, 'from scratch' learning project HRM (Human Resource Management System) written in straight PHP, JS, and HTML/CSS, without the use of any frameworks, libraries, or other codebases.

At the time that I was working on it, it was a simple CRUD application for data mainly on personnel, but also their clients, and other pertinent, day-to-day operations information needed by operations management. It is largely unfinished, and may remain so indefinitely, as the core ideas behind the project have changed, and evolved into what is now [Just-a-Dash](https://github.com/joeflack4/vanillerp)
